# Postscript {#sec-postscript .unnumbered}

Whilst putting these materials together I encountered a [Tim Harford article in the Financial Times about Subtraction Neglect Bias](https://www.ft.com/content/eb616ad3-e680-4161-9e20-53c4607cb609) (Link only accessible to FT subscribers).

Subtraction Neglect Bias is the cognitive bias humans have towards problem solving of adding instead of subtracting.

I experience this bias all the time, either in my own behaviour or observing other people.

Obviously, adding something to an existing situation is often the right way to solve a problem, but frequently removing something would be a better solution.

I assume there is something cognitively painful about subtraction as compared with the cognitive reward of addition that biases us towards addition.

Anyhow, if you are reading this you may be wondering what that's got to do with webpage design? Everything, I'd say. But it also has a lot to do with lots of other things we do at work or at home so I thought I add this little rant at the end (see what I did there?)

For example: PowerPoint slide design. 99.999% of presentations I sit through (screaming inside) have too many slides and/or slides too with much information on each one.

They've literally wasted their time and my time. Can't read them, don't understand them.

How often do people consider subtracting slides, text and images to strengthen their presentations? Presumably the presenter wants me to understand, but is too biased towards keeping the kitchen sink to imagine a better world without it.

So when you next are writing, scheduling meetings, cooking, planning your weekend etc. consider removing words, slides, sections, ingredients, commitments or activities as the way to improve life.
