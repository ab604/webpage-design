    "text": "Preface\nThis short book has been created as a resource for librarians at the University of Southampton and aims to aggregates the most pertinent information found elsewhere about how to create effective webpages for delivering information to library users.\nThe aim here is to encourage you to consider what we know about what works and why, rather than create a rigid framework that you must follow. The overarching questions under consideration are:\n\nWhat do we know about how users engage with webpages?\nWhat do we know about human cognition that applies to webpage design?\nAnd most importantly, what are we actually trying to achieve?\n\nDefining our aims can be challenging, but we can lean on Stuart Sutherland’s definition of acting rationally (Sutherland 2007) when trying to understand if we have answered the third question in the light of the the first two:\nIf our design choices aid achieving our aims they are rational. Whereas if our design choices hinder or confound our aims, they are irrational.\n\n\n\n\nSutherland, Stuart. 2007. Irrationality / Stuart Sutherland. London: Pinter & Martin."

    "text": "2.1 Mobile devices now account for 50% of webpage views in the UK\nFigure 2.1 shows how in the last ten years there has been a change in the way people view the world wide web. In 2011 the majority of users accessed the web using desktop/laptop computers, but by 2022 we see mobile devices such as tablets and phones accounting for half of the views.\nIn November 2023 GOV.UK reported that over 60% of their visits are from mobile devices.\nThis matters because when considering how to create effective webpages we need to consider how our pages work on both channels: computers with traditional keyboards and screens and mobile touch screen only devices.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: The world wide web turned 34 years old in 2023. The grey line shows the share of web views in the UK from desktop computers and the red line shows the share of web views in the UK from mobile devices."

    "text": "2.2 Design webpages to provide a consistent experience across channels\nBroadly speaking, these are the differences between desktop and mobile web experiences:\n\nDesktops/Laptops are best for complex activities (using keyboard and mouse, multiple tabs etc.) and detail rich content (larger screens).\nMobile devices excel at on-the-go features (using GPS or camera) and media consumption (video, images, books, audio etc.), but are more compact and complex tasks can be more difficult using a touchscreen.\n\nGiven our expectation that users are likely to be using either channel when viewing our pages (Figure 2.1), this suggests we should aim for consistency of user experience across channels, rather than optimising for one channel or device.\nConsistency doesn’t mean identical, it means the user has the same core experience regardless of channel.\nWhat consistency means in practice is therefore determined by our overall design aims and adapting the guidance in Chapter 3, Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 for our specific page.\nThere is of course lots more detail on the NN/g: Optimizing for Context in the Omnichannel User Experience page, including discussions on when it’s appropriate to optimise for device rather than consistency."

    "text": "4.1 How to write better sentences\nMy favourite resource for improving writing is a short paper by Jonathan Bennett and Samuel Gorovitz in which they describe ‘Bennett Rules’ for sentences (Bennett and Gorovitz 1997).\nI’ve extracted the Bennett Rules here, but I encourage you read the whole thing as it provides greater context and explanation.\nA key point is that comparison is often the best way to understand whether we can improve a sentence.\n\nVerbs are better than nouns. Compare:\n\nThere is a difference between waving and drowning.\nWaving differs from drowning.\n\nAdverbs are better than adjectives. Compare:\n\nShe is a clear writer.\nShe writes clearly.\n\nFavour the Anglo-Saxon. Compare:\n\nIs it possible for him to…? (possible has Latin roots)\nCan he…? (can has Anglo-Saxon roots)\n\nBanish ‘very’ and its ilk. Compare:\n\nIt’s very unlikely.\nIt’s unlikely.\n\nAbstract nouns should be fought like the devil. Compare:\n\nOur exploration of the formualations’ implications for readability reveals that each are unacceptable.\nWe explore what each formulation implies for readability and find that none are acceptable.\n\nAvoid undue repetition\nBe careful with commas.\nAttend to the sound\n\nUltimately this is about making you think.\nYou may decide a more verbose or Latin rooted construction works best. But these ‘rules’ are to help you think about how to write sentences that the user will find easy to read and understand.\n\n\n\n\nBennett, Jonathan, and Samuel Gorovitz. 1997. “Improving Academic Writing.” Teaching Philosophy 20 (2): 105–20. https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/jfb/bengor.pdf."
