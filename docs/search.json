    "text": "Preface\nThis short book has been created as a resource for librarians at the University of Southampton and aims to aggregates the most pertinant information found elsewhere about how to create effective webpages for delivering information to library users.\nThe aim here is to encourage you to consider what we know about what works and why, rather than create a rigid framework that you must follow. The overarching questions under consideration are:\n\nWhat do we know about how users engage with webpages?\nWhat do we know about human cognition that applies to webpage design?\nAnd most importantly, what are we actually trying to achieve?\n\nDefining our aims can be challenging, but we can lean on Stuart Sutherland’s definition of acting rationally (Sutherland 2007) when trying to understand if we have answered the third question in the light of the the first two:\nIf our design choices aid achieving our aims they are rational. Whereas if our design choices hinder or confound our aims, they are irrational.\n\n\n\n\nSutherland, Stuart. 2007. Irrationality / Stuart Sutherland. London: Pinter & Martin."

    "text": "Given the enormous economic value of the world wide web and attracting users to ones site, there are considerable research efforts into user experience in both the commercial and public sectors.\nTwo leading groups are in the private sector the Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g), and in the public sector the UK Government Digital Service (GDS).\nBoth these groups provide extensive materials detailing their research and guidance on what works (and what doesn’t). I encourage readers to explore their websites and beyond.\nHere are some links to some pages I considered highly relevant for librarians from the NN/g and the GDS:\nhttps://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/\nhttps://www.nngroup.com/topic/writing-web/\nhttps://www.nngroup.com/articles/psychology-study-guide/\nhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles\nhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk\nIf you prefer a book, Letting go of the words by Janice Redish (Redish 2012) covers many of the same topics.\n\n\n\n\nRedish, Janice. 2012.

    "text": "2.1 Mobile devices now account for 50% of webpage views in the UK\nFigure 2.1 shows how in the last ten years there has been a change in the way people view the world wide web. In 2011 the majority of users accessed the web using desktop/laptop computers, but by 2022 we see mobile devices such as tablets and phones accounting for half of the views.\nThis matters because when considering how to create effective webpages we need to consider how our pages work on both computers with traditional keyboards and screens, as well as touch screen only devices.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: The world wide web turned 34 years old in 2023. The grey line shows the share of web views in the UK from desktop computers and the red line shows the share of web views in the UK from mobile devices."
