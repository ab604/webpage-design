It aims to aggregate the most pertinent information available about how to create effective webpages for library users.\nThe material presented here encourages you to consider what we know about what works and why, rather than present a rigid framework that you must follow.\nThe overarching questions under consideration are:\n\nWhat do we know about how users engage with webpages?\nWhat do we know about human cognition that applies to webpage design?\n\nOur goal is to create webpages that work for library users, and in doing so resist the temptation to design for ourselves.",

This is different kind of task to reading a story or learning a subject step-wise. NN/g estimate users will only read around 20% of the text on the average webpage.\nThe behaviour is similar to that of desire lines, humans seeking out the most efficient (or lazy if you prefer) way to do things. Users have found that scanning on the web is more efficient than reading for extracting information.\nNN/g observe we scan in a variety of gaze patterns and therefore we should design and structure our pages for ease of scanning.",

    "text": "3.2 Working memory\nOur working memory is how we store information in the short term. George Miller famously proposed in 1956 that our working memory can hold seven plus or minus two units of information (Miller 1994). More recent evidence suggests that the quality as much as the quantity of the information affects our ability to retain information (Ma, Husain, and Bays 2014).\nWhat is clear is that capacity is limited and that this relates to cognitive load in terms of the quantity and/or difficulty of the information we can retain in the short-term i.e. seconds to minutes.\nUniversity of Southampton Library webpages are predominantly text and links. A quick browse suggests that most pages contain between 600 and 1,200 words. Based on a reading speed of 300 words per minute, this equates to between 2 and 4 minutes if one were to read the entire text.\nUsers are unlikely to read entire pages, let alone retain the contents. They wish to quickly identify the 20% relevant to their visit and move on.\nPage structure, well-written content (Chapter 4) and consistency between pages can all reduce the effort required to sort, extract and retain information.",

    "text": "3.4 How to structure a webpage for ease of scanning\n\n3.4.1 The most important information comes first\nIt might seem obvious, but putting the most popular or important information the user is likely to want at the top of the page will save them time and effort. This assumes that you have some insight into what matters to the user, but if one does then that should be the first thing the user sees.\nThe UK Government Digital Service redesigned their website to reflect their understanding of what users came to do, moving popular content to the top of pages to reduce the scrolling and scanning effort.\nHence the Summary at the start of this chapter page.\nThis approach is also reflected in the inverted pyramid strategy where the information most likely to engage the user comes first, followed by the secondary, tertiary etc. information. Those who want detail can find it further down the page, but those who are only interested in the main point are served it immediately.\nhttps://www.nngroup.com/articles/formatting-long-form-content/\n\n\n3.4.2 Use informative headings\nBecause users scan for information, headings act as markers to help users navigate. This is also true for those using screen readers. Therefore it’s worth spending time thinking about how to make each heading informative and concise.\n\n\n3.4.3 Chunks, bullets and callouts\nChunks of text, bullet or callout can be considered a unit of information we can hold in our working memory (Section 3.2).\nA chunk of text is usually a short paragraph such as this, surrounded by white space so that it is distinct and therefore easier to pick out when scanning.\nBullets or numbered lists are a way of grouping related units of information, whilst callouts such as the summary at the top of this page highlight important units of information.\n\n\n3.4.4 Bolding and highlight\nUse bold font or highlighting text through colour and shape are examples of the Von Restorff effect where the isolation of the words using colour, shape or weight makes them more prominent and memorable.\nThe Von Restorff effect relies on the difference between the thing you want to isolate and everything else, so it becomes ineffective if overused.\n\n\n3.4.5 Helpful visuals\nChapter 5 discusses how to use imagery and visuals in more detail. A helpful visual is one that supports the users aims either by informing or orientating them.\n\n\n3.4.6 Fonts matter. But there is no best font.\nA study by Adobe using English text found reading speeds varied by around a third on average between the best and worst of 16 fonts tested (Wallace et al. 2022). However, they report large variation between individual users reading speed and each font tested, and that other factors such as age, font familiarity and size were important for reading speed. The Adobe study is summarised in NN/g Best font for online reading.\nThis study implies that to account for individual variation it would be preferable to enable users to choose their own font for reading. However that’s generally not possible on a webpage (e-readers often do facilitate font choice).\nTherefore to maximise accessibility (see Section 2.3) what matters is to choose a legible font and size.\nThere is no WCAG standard for font size, but but for reference the GDS use a default paragraph font size is 19px on large screens and 16px on small screens following the recommendations of the British Dyslexia Society not use fonts smaller than 12pt, approximately equivalent to 16px or 1rem.\nHere I have set a base font size of 18px and am using the Atkinson Hyperlegible font designed by the Braille Institute.\n\n\n\n\nMa, Wei Ji, Masud Husain, and Paul M.

A form of loss aversion?\nAnyhow, if you are reading this you may be wondering what that’s got to do with webpage design? Everything, I’d say. But it also has a lot to do with lots of other things we do at work or at home so I thought I add this little rant at the end (see what I did there?)\nFor example: PowerPoint slide design. 99.999% of presentations I sit through (screaming inside) have too many slides and/or slides too with much information on each one.\nThey’ve literally wasted their time and my time. Can’t read them, don’t understand them.\nHow often do people consider subtracting slides, text and images to strengthen their presentations? Presumably the presenter wants me to understand, but is too biased towards keeping the kitchen sink to imagine a better world without it.\nSo when you next are writing, scheduling meetings, cooking, planning your weekend etc. consider removing words, slides, sections, ingredients, commitments or activities as the way to improve life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntoine de Saint-Exupéry, 1939\n\n\n\n“…perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away…”\nSource: Tim Harford, Financial Times, 2024-01-05",
