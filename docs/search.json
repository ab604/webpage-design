    "text": "Preface\nThis short book has been created as a resource for librarians at the University of Southampton. It aims to aggregate the most pertinent information available about how to create effective webpages for library users.\nAs library webpages consist largely of text and links, text-based pages are the focus of this book.\nThe scope does extend to images, but not to video or other media. However, most of the considerations that apply to images, apply to videos and other media.\nThe material presented here encourages you to consider what we know about what works and why, rather than present a rigid framework that you must follow.\nThe overarching questions under consideration are:\n\nWhat do we know about how users engage with webpages?\nWhat do we know about human cognition that applies to webpage design?\n\nOur goal is to create webpages that work for library users, and in doing so resist the temptation to design for ourselves.",

    "text": "2.1 Mobile devices now account for 50% of webpage views in the UK\nFigure 2.1 shows how in the last ten years there has been a change in the way people view the world wide web. In 2011 the majority of users accessed the web using desktop/laptop computers, but by 2022 we see mobile devices such as tablets and phones accounting for half of the views.\nIn November 2023 GOV.UK reported that over 60% of their visits are from mobile devices.\nHowever, Google Analytics data for the University of Southampton Library pages shows that in the 12 months between January 2023 to January 2024 approximately 70% of visits are from devices with traditional keyboards. My assumption is that this reflects a greater proportion of users carrying out activities best suited to devices with keyboards and larger screens at the same time as they are accessing the Library website than across the web as a whole.\nIn general, when considering how to create effective webpages we need to consider how our pages work on both channels: computers with traditional keyboards and screens and mobile touch screen only devices.\nFigure 2.1: The world wide web turned 34 years old in 2023. The grey line shows the share of web views in the UK from desktop computers and the red line shows the share of web views in the UK from mobile devices.",

    "text": "2.2 Design webpages to provide a consistent experience across channels\nBroadly speaking, these are the differences between desktop and mobile web experiences:\n\nDesktops/Laptops are best for complex activities (using keyboard and mouse, multiple tabs etc.) and detail rich content (larger screens).\nMobile devices excel at on-the-go features (using GPS or camera) and media consumption (video, images, books, audio etc.), but are more compact and complex tasks can be more difficult using a touchscreen.\n\nOur data indicates users accessing library pages are more likely to be using desktops than mobile devices for any given visit, but many users have both types of device and may visit using either and different times. Therefore if we have the choice, this suggests we should aim for consistency of user experience across channels, rather than optimising for one channel or device.\nConsistency doesn’t mean identical, it means the user has the same core experience regardless of channel (and/or page).\nWhat consistency means in practice is therefore determined by our overall design aims and adapting the guidance in Chapter 3, Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 for our specific page.\nThere is of course lots more detail on the NN/g: Optimizing for Context in the Omnichannel User Experience page, including discussions on when it’s appropriate to optimise for device rather than consistency.",

(Such as WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)\n\n\n\nThe World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 are a set of recommendations for web accessibility to improve inclusion of users with impairments to their vision, hearing, mobility, thinking or understanding\nThese guidelines follow four design principles that pages should be:\n\nPerceivable\nOperable\nUnderstandable\nRobust\n\nThe University of Southampton is expected to meet the WCAG AA standard for accessibility.\nThe WCAG provide a Quick Reference which has examples, but is ironically a bit overwhelming! WebAIM provide an in-depth WCAG 2.2. AA checklist too that is slightly easier to use.\nWebAIM also provide many tools, including their WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool which can highlight issues on your page.\nAs library pages primarily consist of text and links, the University of Washington Accessibility Checklist may provide sufficiently concise guidance, but with more detail than the minimal list at the start of this section.\nIt may not be possible to achieve perfect accessibility due to the trade-off one encounters between competing user needs, but the important thing is to try.",

This is a different kind of task to reading a story or learning a subject step-wise. NN/g estimate users will only read around 20% of the text on the average webpage.\nThe behaviour is similar to that of desire lines, humans seeking out the most efficient (or lazy if you prefer) way to do things. Users have found that scanning on the web is more efficient than reading for extracting information.\nNN/g observe we scan in a variety of gaze patterns and therefore we should design and structure our pages for ease of scanning.

George Miller famously proposed in 1956 that our working memory can hold seven plus or minus two units of information2. More recent evidence suggests that the quality as much as the quantity of the information affects our ability to retain information3.\nWhat is clear is that capacity is limited and that this relates to cognitive load in terms of the quantity and/or difficulty of the information we can retain in the short-term i.e. seconds to minutes.\nUniversity of Southampton Library webpages are predominantly text and links. A quick browse suggests that most pages contain between 600 and 1,200 words. Based on a reading speed of 300 words per minute, this equates to between 2 and 4 minutes if one were to read the entire text.\nUsers are unlikely to read entire pages, let alone retain the contents. They wish to quickly identify the 20% relevant to their visit and move on.\nPage structure, well-written content (Chapter 4) and consistency between pages can all reduce the effort required to sort, extract and retain information.",

    "text": "3.4 How to structure a webpage for ease of scanning\n\n3.4.1 The most important information comes first\nIt might seem obvious, but putting the most popular or important information the user is likely to want at the top of the page will save them time and effort. This assumes that you have some insight into what matters to the user, but if one does then that should be the first thing the user sees.\nThe UK Government Digital Service redesigned their website to reflect their understanding of what users came to do, moving popular content to the top of pages to reduce the scrolling and scanning effort.\nHence the Summary at the start of this chapter page.\nThis approach is also reflected in the inverted pyramid strategy where the information most likely to engage the user comes first, followed by the secondary, tertiary etc. information. Those who want detail can find it further down the page, but those who are only interested in the main point are served it immediately.\n\n\n3.4.2 Use informative headings\nBecause users scan for information, headings act as markers to help users navigate. This is also true for those using screen readers. Therefore it’s worth spending time thinking about how to make each heading informative and concise.\n\n\n3.4.3 Chunks, bullets and callouts\nChunks of text, bullet or callout can be considered a unit of information we can hold in our working memory (Section 3.2).\nA chunk of text is usually a short paragraph such as this, surrounded by white space so that it is distinct and therefore easier to pick out when scanning.\nBullets or numbered lists are a way of grouping related units of information, whilst callouts such as the summary at the top of this page highlight important units of information.\n\n\n3.4.4 Bolding and highlight\nUsing bold font or highlighting text through colour and/or shape are examples of the Von Restorff effect where the isolation of the words using colour, shape or weight makes them more prominent and memorable.\nThe Von Restorff effect relies on the difference between the thing you want to isolate and everything else, so it becomes ineffective if overused.\n\n\n3.4.5 Helpful visuals\nChapter 5 discusses how to use imagery and visuals in more detail. A helpful visual is one that supports the user’s aims either by informing or orientating them.\n\n\n3.4.6 Fonts matter. But there is no best font.\nA study by Adobe using English text found reading speeds varied by around a third on average between the best and worst of 16 fonts tested4. However, they report large variation between individual user’s reading speed and each font tested, and that other factors such as age, font familiarity and size were important for reading speed. The Adobe study is summarised in NN/g Best font for online reading.\nThis study implies that to account for individual variation it would be preferable to enable users to choose their own font for reading. However that’s generally not possible on a webpage (e-readers often do facilitate font choice).\nTherefore to maximise accessibility (see Section 2.3) what matters is to choose a legible font and size.\nThere is no WCAG standard for font size or font face, but for reference the GDS use a default paragraph font size of 19px on large screens and 16px on small screens. This follows the recommendations of the British Dyslexia Society to not use fonts smaller than 12pt, approximately equivalent to 16px/1rem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn aside: pt, px and rem\n\n\n\nCascading Style Sheets (CSS) specify the presentation of styling of webpages and have several ways of expressing units of length. This W3 consortium tutorial page on CSS units of length has full details and examples.\nPoints (pt) is an absolute length (for font size) originating in typography, such that a 12pt font is around 4.2 mm in size. (Try measuring the letters for a 12pt font your screen in Word or Outlook.)\nPixels (px) are absolute numbers, but a pixel is defined by the viewing device, such that 1px might be one dot on a display with few dots, but represented by multiple dots on a display comprising of many dots. So whilst 16px should be around 12pt or 4.2 mm on most screens, the screen resolution (number of dots) will determine the actual size.\nRelative to font-size of the root element (rem) means scale the font size relative to a defined absolute font size in px - the root element. So if we define a root font size of 16px, 1rem is 16px and 2rem is 32px etc. And 2rem would be around 24pt or 8.4 mm on most screens.\nTL:DR define a root font size of at least 16px (personally I’d go with 18px) and ensure all other font sizes on your page are at least 1 rem.\n\n\nSuggested fonts for legibility are sans serif fonts such as Calibri, Arial or a serif font such as Garamond, but remember to be consistent across pages on the same site4.\nHere I have set a root font size of 18px and am using the Atkinson Hyperlegible font designed by the Braille Institute.\n\n\n\n\n1.

    "section": "6.3 Language Example",
    "text": "6.3 Language Example\nI asked Claude Sonnet to describe Rule 59 of the Highway Code. This was the response:\n\nRule 59 of the Highway Code provides guidance on proper clothing and protective gear for cyclists. It states the following:\nYou should avoid wearing clothes that could get tangled in the bicycle’s chain or wheels, or that might obscure your lights while cycling. This could include loose or flowing garments, items with dangling straps or cords, or any clothing that is overly baggy or ill-fitting.\nThe rule recommends wearing light-colored or fluorescent clothing during the day and in poor light conditions, as this can help other road users see you more easily. Reflective clothing and accessories, such as reflective belts, arm or ankle bands, are also advised for increased visibility at night or in low-light situations.\nAdditionally, Rule 59 emphasizes the importance of wearing a cycle helmet that conforms to current regulations and safety standards. The helmet should be the correct size and properly fastened to ensure a secure fit. Research suggests that a correctly fitted helmet can significantly reduce the risk of sustaining a head injury in certain circumstances or accidents while cycling.\nIn summary, Rule 59 advises cyclists to wear appropriate clothing that does not pose an entanglement hazard, choose visible and reflective garments for increased conspicuity, and always wear a properly fitted and approved cycle helmet to protect against head injuries.\n\nTry interpreting this description to write Rule 59.\nTo illustrate the effect of language on user experience I created two versions of Rule 59 based on the actual text. Are they good writing? How would you describe them?\nExpand the box to read the first version:\n\nShow Version 1 of Rule 59\n \n\n  \n  \nVestiary accoutrements. One ought to eschew sartorial assemblages that may become entrapped within the continuous chain or rotational apparatus, or occlude the luminescent signaling devices during the act of cycling. Garments exhibiting a high degree of luminance or fluorescence can augment the perceptibility to other vehicular operators in diurnal and suboptimal illumination conditions, while attire or accessories (such as belts, arm bands, or ankle adornments) imbued with retroreflective properties can amplify one's conspicuity in conditions of nocturnal obscurity.\n\n\nIt is advisable to don a cranial protective apparatus conforming to current regulatory mandates, exhibiting an appropriate dimensional correspondence, and securely affixed. Empirical evidence suggests that a properly fitted cranial shield can mitigate the risk of sustaining cephalic trauma in certain contingencies.\n  \n  \nExpand the box to read the second version:\n\nShow Version 2 of Rule 59\n \n\n  \nClothing, you should avoid wearing garments that may become entangled in the bicycle chain or wheels, or that may obstruct your lights while you are cycling, thus posing a potential safety hazard. Clothing items that are light-colored or fluorescent in nature can significantly enhance your visibility to other road users under daylight conditions and in situations of poor lighting, whereas reflective clothing and accessories, such as reflective belts, arm bands, or ankle bands, can substantially increase your conspicuity and visibility in the dark, thereby reducing the risk of accidents or collisions.\n\n\nFurthermore, it is highly recommended that you wear a cycle helmet that conforms to the current regulations and safety standards, ensuring that it is of the correct size and securely fastened to your head, as extensive research and evidence strongly suggest that a correctly fitted and properly worn cycle helmet can significantly reduce your risk of sustaining a head injury in the event of certain circumstances or accidents that may occur while cycling.\n  \n  \nBelow is the actual text from the Highway Code. What makes this good writing?\n\nShow Highway Code Rule 59\n \n\n  \nClothing. You should avoid clothes that may get tangled in the chain, or in a wheel or may obscure your lights when you are cycling.\n\n\nLight-coloured or fluorescent clothing can help other road users to see you in daylight and poor light, while reflective clothing and/or accessories (belt, arm or ankle bands) can increase your visibility in the dark.\n\n\nYou should wear a cycle helmet that conforms to current regulations, is the correct size and securely fastened.

    "text": "Whilst putting these materials together I encountered a Tim Harford article in the Financial Times about Subtraction Neglect Bias (Link only accessible to FT subscribers.) .\nSubtraction Neglect Bias is the cognitive bias humans have towards problem solving of adding instead of subtracting.\nI experience this bias all the time, either in my own behaviour or observing other people.\nObviously, adding something to an existing situation is often the right way to solve a problem, but frequently removing something would be a better solution.\nI assume there is something cognitively painful about subtraction as compared with a cognitive reward of addition that biases us towards addition. A form of loss aversion?\nAnyhow, if you are reading this you may be wondering what that’s got to do with webpage design? Everything, I’d say. But it also has a lot to do with lots of other things we do at work or at home so I thought I’d mention it here as a general issue.\nFor example: PowerPoint slide design. Many presentations have too many slides and/or slide(s) too with much information on each one. Which I assume is a result of successive additions aimed at improving the presentation, when in fact it has the opposite effect. The result is slides that are difficult to read or understand, especially when the presenter is also talking. Most, if not all, presentations and slides would be strengthened by having less in them.\nSo when you next create a webpage, are writing, scheduling meetings, cooking, planning your weekend etc. consider removing words, slides, sections, ingredients, commitments or activities and see if it improves things, rather than adding more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntoine de Saint-Exupéry, 1939\n\n\n\n“…perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away…”\nSource: Tim Harford, Financial Times, 2024-01-05",
