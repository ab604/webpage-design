# How people read webpages {#sec-how-do-people-read-webpages}

[Summary:]{.highlight} People don't read webpages, they scan the page for relevant information. This suggests we should structure our pages, formatting and composing the text, to make scanning easy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## People scan webpages {#sec-people-scan-webpages}

NN/g publish a book called [How People Read on the Web](https://www.nngroup.com/reports/how-people-read-web-eyetracking-evidence/) [@pernice2021] in which they detail the results of their large scale eye tracking studies.

This is how NN/g describe scanning versus reading [@pernice2021]:

> The acts of scanning and reading are quite different. Reading includes looking at most words in chronological order in a section or on an entire page. But when scanning, people look at words, headings, or sections of pages, often out of order, fixating on only some of the words, not entire lines of text.

The hypothesis NN/g present for why we scan is because users are often looking for specific information when reading on the web. This is different kind of task to reading a story or learning a subject step-wise.

The behaviour is similar to that of [desire lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path), humans seeking out the most efficient (or lazy if you prefer) way to do things. Users have found that scanning on the web is more efficient than reading for extracting information.

NN/g observe we scan in a variety of [gaze patterns](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/text-scanning-patterns-eyetracking/) and therefore we should design and structure our pages for ease of scanning.

## Working memory {#sec-working-memory}

Our working memory is how we store information in the short term. George Miller famously proposed in 1956 that our working memory can hold seven plus or minus two items of information @miller1994. More recent evidence suggests that the quality as much as the quantity of the information affects our ability to retain information @ma2014.

What is clear is that capacity is limited and that this relates to cognitive load in terms of the quantity and/or difficulty of the information we can retain in the short-term i.e. seconds to minutes.

University of Southampton Library webpages are predominantly text and links. A quick browse suggested that most pages contain between 600 and 1,200 words. Based on a reading speed of 300 words per minute, this equates to between 2 and 4 minutes if one were to read the entire text.

As users are unlikely to read entire pages, let alone retain the contents, we need to facilitate their parsing of the constitute parts to identify the information relevant to their visit.

Page structure, well-written content (@sec-how-to-write-for-the-web) and consistency between pages can all reduce the effort required to sort and extract information.

## The unconsidered webpage is not worth creating {#sec-the-unconsidered-webpage-is-not-worth-creating}

In @sec-how-to-write-for-the-web I outline some practical ways to improve writing, but before creating a webpage it's worth spending time considering:

-   the purpose of the page

-   what the user will be looking for

-   how and at what level of detail to present the content to them

Careful consideration increases the likelihood of creating relevant content in an appropriate form, as opposed to a long winded page that no-one reads. For the reasons outlined in @sec-working-memory.

## How to structure a webpage for ease of scanning {#sec-how-to-structure-a-webpage-for-ease-of-scanning}

### The most important information comes first {#sec-the-most-important-information-comes-first}

It might seem obvious, but putting the most popular or important information the user is likely to want at the top of the page will save them time and effort. This assumes that you have some insight into what matters to the user, but if one does then that should be the first thing the user sees.

The UK Government Digital Service [redesigned their website](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2023/11/01/a-bold-new-look-for-the-gov-uk-homepage/) to reflect their understanding of what users came to do, moving popular content to the top of pages to reduce the scrolling and scanning effort.

Hence the summaries at the start of each chapter page.

This approach is also reflected in the [inverted pyramid](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/inverted-pyramid/) strategy where the information most likely to engage the user comes first, followed by the secondary, tertiary etc. information. Those who want detail can find it further down the page, but those who are only interested in the main point are served it immediately.

### Use informative headings

Headings are usually in

Informative headings also help with accessibility.

### Chunks, bullets, summaries and callouts

### Bolding and highlight

### Helpful visuals

Good visuals

### Fonts matter

But not as much as you might think.
