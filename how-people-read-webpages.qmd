# How do people read webpages?

## What's the first thing we do on landing on a web page?

Check we are where we want to be! If not, we move on.

What does that imply about page design?

## What is the difference between the web and other formats?

-   We scan in an F-pattern.

-   Long form (\>1,000 words) we read in chunks, look for summaries, highlights or key-points.

## Are there differences between desktop/laptop and mobile devices?
