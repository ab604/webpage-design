# How people read webpages {#sec-how-do-people-read-webpages}

People don't read webpages in the traditional sense of the beginning to the end, 
they ***scan*** the page for the information they came for.

## What's the first thing we do on landing on a web page?

Check we are where we want to be! If not, we move on.

What does that imply about page design?

## What is the difference between the web and other formats?

-   We scan in an F-pattern.

-   Long form (\>1,000 words) we read in chunks, look for summaries, highlights or key-points.
