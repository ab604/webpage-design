I replaced words with Latin roots (such as "library", "catalogues", and "database") with English words of German origin (such as "learning", "rooms", "spaces", "clusters", and "data"). I used words derived from Germanic languages to create the text. Please note that the resulting text may sound unusual to non-native speakers of English, as it uses vocabulary and word order specific to Germanic languages. Let me know if you'd like me to make any further changes!
