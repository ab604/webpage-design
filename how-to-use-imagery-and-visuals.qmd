There are lots of trade-offs when using imagery. Imagery can help create ambiance, impart information or orientate the user. But images should not be used to provide information alone. Images slow down page loading and increase scrolling and scanning time, especially on mobile devices.

## How to use images {#sec-misconceptions-about-users-and-images}

Users are primarily visiting Library webpages are to access information or services. Therefore images and visuals should support the users aims either by informing or orientating the user.

Be wary of using images that don't do either or these things, and never rely on imagery alone to provide information. This will exclude users who cannot see or access the image (See @sec-designing-for-accessibility).

Images can also make scanning more difficult and increase scrolling time, especially on mobile devices. Remember that users are just as likely to be accessing from a mobile device than a desktop or laptop computer (@sec-mobile-devices-now-account-for-50-of-webpage-views-in-the-uk).

Therefore use images carefully and consider the trade-off in either including or excluding an image or visualisation.

## Types of images

### Informative images

-   Photographs: if you need to show a lifelike representation of something such as a piece of equipment or room that can be booked.

-   Illustrations: useful for implication of a complex process.

-   Icons and logos: used to represent menus, actions or objects and can orientate the user on the page as they are easy to scan. However, icons don't have universal meaning and are open to misinterpretation.

-   Infographics and data visualisations:

### Decorative images

Decorative images are those which don't inform, but may help orientate the user. They are used to create ambiance and should not have alt text for screen readers.
