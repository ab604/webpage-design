## What to read instead

Given the enormous economic value of the world wide web and attracting users to ones site, there is extensive on-going research into user experience in both the commercial and public sectors.

Two leading groups are the private sector [Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g)](https://www.nngroup.com/) and in the public sector the UK [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service) .

Both these groups provide extensive materials detailing their research and guidance on what works (and what doesn't). I encourage readers to explore their websites and beyond.

Here are some links to some pages I considered highly relevant for librarians:

If you prefer a book, [Letting go of the words by Janice Redish](https://southampton.on.worldcat.org/oclc/798674328) covers many of the same topics.
