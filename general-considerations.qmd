# General considerations

This page considers 

## Mobile devices now account for 50% of webpage views in the UK

@fig-uk-web-use shows how in the last ten years there has been a change in the way people view the world wide web. In 2011 the majority of users accessed the web using desktop/laptop computers, but by 2022 we see mobile devices such as tablets and phones accounting for half of the views.

This matters because when considering how to create effective webpages we need to consider how our pages work on both computers with traditional keyboards and screens, as well as touch screen only devices.
