# Preface {.unnumbered}

This short book has been created as a resource for librarians at the University of Southampton and aims to aggregates the most pertinent information found elsewhere about how to create effective webpages for delivering information to library users.

The aim here is to encourage you to consider what we know about what works and why, rather than create a rigid framework that you must follow.

The overarching questions under consideration are:

-   What do we know about how users engage with webpages?

-   What do we know about human cognition that applies to webpage design?

Our goal is to create webpages that work for library users, and in doing so resist the temptation to design for ourselves.
