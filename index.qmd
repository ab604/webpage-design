<!-- ## The WWW is 34 years old, how are people viewing? -->

<!-- ## What's the first thing we do on landing on a web page? -->

<!-- Check we are where we want to be! If not, we move on. -->

<!-- What does that imply about page design? -->

<!-- ## What is the difference between the web and other formats? -->

<!-- -   We scan in an F-pattern. -->

<!-- -   Long form (\>1,000 words) we read in chunks, look for summaries, highlights or key-points. -->

<!-- ## Why would we use visuals? -->

<!-- -   To impart information that cannot be easily expressed in words e.g. trends. -->

<!-- -   To create ambience. -->

<!-- ## Why would we not use visuals? -->

<!-- -   They make scanning more difficult, especially on mobile devices. -->

<!-- ## How do we improve sentences? -->

<!-- Bennett Rules: -->
<!-- https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/jfb/bengor.pdf -->
<!-- 1.  Verbs are better than nouns -->
<!-- 2.  Adverbs are better than adjectives -->
<!-- 3.  Favour the Anglo-Saxon -->
<!-- 4.  Banish 'very' and its ilk -->
<!-- 5.  Abstract nouns should be fought like the devil -->
<!-- 6.  Avoid undue repetition -->
<!-- 7.  Be careful with commas. -->
<!-- 8.  Attend to the sound -->
