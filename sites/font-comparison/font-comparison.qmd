# [Cheeky boar leaves nudist grunting in laptop chase]{style="font-family:'EB Garamond'"}<br>

[**A nudist in Berlin got too close to nature for comfort when a wild boar snatched his plastic bag - which had his laptop inside.** <br> The naked man gave chase to the boar and her two piglets - much to the amusement of fellow sunbathers. <br> Adele Landauer, an actor and life coach, took photos of the chase at Teufelssee - a popular bathing spot - and put them on Facebook. <br> "Nature strikes back!" she wrote, adding that the man laughed it all off. <br> "He gave it his all", with not a stitch on, she reported. "I then showed the photos to the man, he laughed soundly and authorised me to make them public."]{style="font-family:'EB Garamond'"}
