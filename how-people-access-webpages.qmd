# How people access the web {#sec-how-people-access-the-web}

In the UK, people are now as likely to access the web via a mobile device as they are a traditional desktop or laptop computer. This suggests we should design webpages to provide a consistent user experience across devices.

## Mobile devices now account for 50% of webpage views in the UK {#sec-mobile-devices-now-account-for-50-of-webpage-views-in-the-uk}

@fig-uk-web-use shows how in the last ten years there has been a change in the way people view the world wide web. In 2011 the majority of users accessed the web using desktop/laptop computers, but by 2022 we see mobile devices such as tablets and phones accounting for half of the views.

In November 2023 [GOV.UK reported](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2023/11/01/a-bold-new-look-for-the-gov-uk-homepage/) that over 60% of their visits are from mobile devices.

This matters because when considering how to create effective webpages we need to consider how our pages work on both channels: computers with traditional keyboards and screens and mobile touch screen only devices.

## Design webpages to provide a consistent experience across channels {#sec-design-webpages-to-provide-a-consistent-experience-across-channels}

Broadly speaking, these are the differences between desktop and mobile web experiences:

-   Desktops/Laptops are best for complex activities (using keyboard and mouse, multiple tabs etc.) and detail rich content (larger screens).

-   Mobile devices excel at on-the-go features (using GPS or camera) and media consumption (video, images, books, audio etc.), but are more compact and complex tasks can be more difficult using a touchscreen.

Given our expectation that users are likely to be using either channel when viewing our pages (@fig-uk-web-use), this suggests we should aim for consistency of user experience across channels, rather than optimising for one channel or device.

Consistency doesn't mean identical, it means the user has the same core experience regardless of channel (and/or page).

What consistency means in practice is therefore determined by our overall design aims and adapting the guidance in @sec-how-do-people-read-webpages, @sec-how-to-write-for-the-web and @sec-using-imagery-and-visuals for our specific page.

There is of course lots more detail on the [NN/g: Optimizing for Context in the Omnichannel User Experience](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/context-specific-cross-channel/) page, including discussions on when it's appropriate to optimise for device rather than consistency.

## Designing for accessibility {#sec-designing-for-accessibility}

::: {#accessiblity-checklist .callout-tip title="A minimal checklist for an accessible text and links webpage"}
-   Are the headings sufficiently informative to enable navigation using a screen reader?

-   Is the contrast ratio between text colour and background colour accessible?

-   Is the font size accessible and legible? (See @sec-fonts-matter)

-   Have any visuals got alt text? (See @sec-making-imagery-accessible)

-   Have you checked you page using an accessibility checker? (Such as [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/))

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) are a set of recommendations for web accessibility to improve inclusion of users with impairments to their:

-   vision

-   hearing

-   mobility

-   thinking or understanding

These guidelines follow four design principles:

1.  Perceivable
2.  Operable
3.  Understandable
4.  Robust

The University is expected to meet the WCAG AA standard for accessibility.

The WCAG provide a [Quick Reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/) which has examples, but is ironically a bit overwhelming! [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/) provide an in-depth [WCAG 2.2. AA checklist](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist) too that is slightly easier to use.

WebAIM also provide many tools, including their [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) which can highlight issues on your page.

As library pages primarily consist of text and links, the [University of Washington Accessibility Checklist](https://www.washington.edu/accesstech/checklist/) may provide sufficiently concise guidance, but with more detail than the minimal list at the start of this section.

It may not be possible to achieve perfect accessibility due to the trade-offs one encounters between competing user needs, but the important thing is to try.
