To summarize, the most common accessibility issues I see are:

-   Embedded links not distinguishable

    Links embedded in text should be distinguishable from the surrounding text - either through styling (like an underline) or by making sure there is sufficient contrast with the surrounding text (see Accessibility Insights: Link in text block).

-   Insufficient colour contrast

    Text, graphics, and user interface components must have sufficient colour contrast with the background (see the WebAIM Contrast Checker for required contrast ratios).

-   Alt-text missing

    Images must have alt-text, unless they are decorative, in which case a null text alternative (alt="") must be provided (see the WAI Images Tutorial).

-   Not keyboard accessible

    Users must be able to navigate to navigate to all interactive components using a keyboard only (see WCAG Success Criterion 2.1.1: Keyboard (Level A)).
