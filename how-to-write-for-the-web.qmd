# How to write for the web {#sec-how-to-write-for-the-web}

[Summary:]{.highlight} Good writing is easy to read and understand. It uses short sentences, simple vocabulary and is broken into chunks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

@sec-how-do-people-read-webpages covered how we should format and structure a webpage in the light of understanding that users scan pages rather than read them. Here we discuss the writing itself.

As usual the question is, *"given what we know, what makes sense?"*

We know:

-   Users scan rather than read

-   Users come for information

-   Users have limited cognitive capacity

This implies:

-   We need to make the page easy to scan, not just in structure, but through our use of language

-   Jargon or complex language is a bad idea

-   Be concise

## How to write better sentences {#sec-how-to-write-better-sentences}

My favourite resource for improving writing is a short paper by Jonathan Bennett and Samuel Gorovitz in which they describe 'Bennett Rules' for sentences [@bennett1997].

I've extracted the Bennett Rules here, but I encourage you read the whole thing as it provides greater context and explanation.

A key point is that comparison is often the best way to understand whether we can improve a sentence.

1.  Verbs are better than nouns. Compare:

    > There is a difference between waving and drowning.
    >
    > Waving differs from drowning.

2.  Adverbs are better than adjectives. Compare:

    > She is a clear writer.
    >
    > She writes clearly.

3.  Favour the Anglo-Saxon. Compare:

    > Is it possible for him to...? (*possible* has Latin roots)
    >
    > Can he...? (*can* has Anglo-Saxon roots)

4.  Banish 'very' and its ilk. Compare:

    > It's very unlikely.
    >
    > It's unlikely.

5.  Abstract nouns should be fought like the devil. Compare:

    > Our exploration of the formulations' implications for readability reveals that each are unacceptable.
    >
    > We explore what each formulation implies for readability and find that none are acceptable.

6.  Avoid undue repetition

7.  Be careful with commas.

8.  Attend to the sound

Ultimately this is about making you think.

You may decide a more verbose or Latin rooted construction works best. But these 'rules' are to help you think about how to write sentences that the user will find easy to read and understand.

## Make link text informative {#sec-make-link-text-informative}

When linking, rather than "here", "more" or "go", use descriptive text or the page title as the link.
