# How to write for the web {#sec-how-to-write-for-the-web}

[Summary:]{.highlight} Good writing is easy to read and understand. It uses short sentences, simple vocabulary and is broken into chunks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

@sec-how-do-people-read-webpages covered how we should format and structure a webpage in the light of understanding that users scan pages rather than read them. Here we discuss the writing itself.

The question we seek to answer is, *"given what we know, what makes sense?"*

We know:

-   Users scan rather than read

-   Users come for information

-   Users have limited cognitive capacity

This implies:

-   We need to make the page easy to scan, not just in structure, but through our use of language

-   Jargon or complex language is a bad idea

-   Be concise

NN/g have a page collating articles and videos specifically related to writing for the web based on their research: [NN/g UX Writing: Study Guide](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-writing-study-guide/)

## How to write better sentences {#sec-how-to-write-better-sentences}

My favourite resource for improving writing is a short paper by Jonathan Bennett and Samuel Gorovitz in which they describe 'Bennett Rules' for sentences [@bennett1997].

I've extracted the Bennett Rules here, but I encourage you read the whole thing as it provides greater context and explanation.

A key point is that comparison is often the best way to understand whether we can improve a sentence.

1.  Verbs are better than nouns. Compare:

    > There is a difference between waving and drowning.

    > Waving differs from drowning.

2.  Adverbs are better than adjectives. Compare:

    > She is a clear writer.

    > She writes clearly.

3.  Favour the Anglo-Saxon. Compare:

    > Is it possible for him to...? (*possible* has Latin roots)

    > Can he...? (*can* has Anglo-Saxon roots)

4.  Banish 'very' and its ilk. Compare:

    > It's very unlikely.

    > It's unlikely.

5.  Abstract nouns should be fought like the devil. Compare:

    > Our exploration of the formulations' implications for readability reveals that each are unacceptable.

    > We explore what each formulation implies for readability and find that none are acceptable.

6.  Avoid undue repetition.

7.  Be careful with commas. *I'd extend this rule to suggest that breaking long sentences into smaller ones is generally good advice. Sentences full of commas, semi-colons and colons are potentially more confusing and harder to read.*

8.  Attend to the sound. Test your writing by reading it aloud.

As discussed in @sec-the-unconsidered-webpage-is-not-worth-creating , the purpose of these rules is provide practical guidance when creating your content. You may decide a more verbose or Latin rooted construction works best. The aim is to help you think about how to write sentences that the user will find easy to read and understand.

## Make link text informative {#sec-make-link-text-informative}

When linking, rather than "here", "more" or "go", use descriptive text or the page title as the link.

## Editing your own words {#sec-editing-your-own-words}

Ideally you'd have an editor available to review and copyedit your words, but this isn't always possible. Hannah Boursnell has written a two part blog with advice on how to edit your own work: [10 editing hacks - Part 1](https://www.hannahboursnell.com/blog/10editinghacks) and [10 editing hacks - Part 2](https://www.hannahboursnell.com/blog/10editinghacks2).
