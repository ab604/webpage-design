# Writing better sentences

Bennett Rules [@bennett1997] :

1.  Verbs are better than nouns
2.  Adverbs are better than adjectives
3.  Favour the Anglo-Saxon
4.  Banish 'very' and its ilk
5.  Abstract nouns should be fought like the devil
6.  Avoid undue repetition
7.  Be careful with commas.
8.  Attend to the sound
